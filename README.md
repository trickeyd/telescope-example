<h3>An example for @idiosync/telescope - by  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~idiosync"><img width="100px" height="31px" valign="middle" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/idiosync-web-images/telescope/idiosync_very_small.png"></a></h3>

Telescope can be downloaded [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@idiosync/telescope "telescope framework")
 

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- In the terminal run "yarn"
- Start the server with "yarn start"
- view "App.js"


## Info
This is purely to illustrait some of the workings of the Telescope framework so much of the simple
view logic going through the framework would actually be over engineering in a real project.

Everything is found in the App.js file. This would also not be reconmended.
